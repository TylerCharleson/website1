    <p>Oosimching is having a spiritual bath in the river or ocean. Usually cleansing yourself with cedar bows while you pray. My grandpa taught me that our people did this in the ocean during summertime, and in the river during fall and winter. Since November of 2019, I have been able to Oosimch regularly with one of my cousins, about two or three times a week. Some local spots here on the island have been beautiful to check out, usually picking a location that has some privacy. Here are some the places I have checked out to Oosimch!   </p> <img>

      <p>The Waterfalls are located about a 10-minute drive from Sproat Lake, then about a 15-minute hike down a pretty steep hill. Absolute peace when you arrive there, completely disconnected from the world. This photo was taken at the beginning of October this year. There is a covered sign where the trail begins, with a map attached so you can find the Waterfalls.   </p> <img>  </section> </div>
